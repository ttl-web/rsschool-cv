### Briefly About Myself:

I am 26 years old, I graduated from university in 2023 with a degree in computer science and computer engineering. My current job does not involve growth as such, so I really need an activity in which I can develop and improve. That is why I am here. My goal is to gain knowledge in front-end development.<br>

I have good interpersonal skills and I work well in a team, and besides learning front-end, I learn English step by step every day, which has become my habit.<br>

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth.<br>

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.<br>
